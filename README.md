## Brief Description

Memento Health is an easy-to-use and secure web application dedicated to creating fully customizable forms to be used by healthcare professionals to assist in gathering, analyzing, and managing patient data.


## Application Goals

Our task for this project was to construct a working patient check-in system. The system allows patients to submit information in the form of a questionnaire. The admin of each subscribing clinic creates a questionnaire depending on the needs of the clinic. Medical assistants first select the patients checking in. They then select one or more forms from a list and allow the patient to fill them in. The forms must have various accessibility features and a progress bar. Once all the forms are completed, the screen returns to the PIN screen. If patient data needs to be altered further or deleted, a PIN will be required. Once the patient is ready to be checked in, the doctors are able to view current and historical patient data.


## Main Features

* Fully customizable forms
* Conditional flow
* Role-based security
* Account security and submission PIN lock
* Graphical question flow
* Historical submission view
* Mobile-friendly submission page design
* Responsive design
* Patient import and management
* Provider, patient, and submission analytics
* Easy-to-navigate submission pages
* Submission progress bar
* Number of remaining submission questions
* Various question types
* Interactive image point selection
